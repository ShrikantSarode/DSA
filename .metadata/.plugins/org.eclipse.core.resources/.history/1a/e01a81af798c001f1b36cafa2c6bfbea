//Problem Statement:
//Create a linear linked list-based system to manage employee information. Each node in the linked list should store the following employee attributes:
//
//A unique integer identifier for the employee.
//A string representing the employee's name.
//A floating-point number representing the employee's salary.
//A string representing the employee's email address.
//The system should provide the following functionalities:
//Add a new employee to the linked list.
//Find an employee based on their ID,if found will return details.
//Display information for all employees in the linked list as a list .
//Input:
//
//Employee information (ID, name, salary, email) for registration.
//Search criteria (ID).
//Output:
//
//Success message for successful registration.
//Employee information for search results.
//List of all employees in the system.
//Constraints:
//
//Employee IDs should be unique.
//The system should handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., invalid input, employee not found).
//The linked list should be implemented efficiently for optimal performance.
